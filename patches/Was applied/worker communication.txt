Worker Communication.diff patch in your patches folder improves web worker management and error handling in app.js. Hereâ€™s a summary of what it does:

Adds robust worker creation with try/catch and error reporting.
Ensures workers are terminated after result or error.
Centralizes worker message handling with a handleWorkerMessage function.
Handles cancellation: if state.isCancelled is set, predictions return a "cancelled" result.
Ensures fallback predictions are returned if worker creation fails or errors occur.
Cleans up activeWorkers state and worker resources more reliably.
