# Prioritized Next-Step Tasks

This file tracks the current prioritized development tasks for the project. Each task is listed with a summary, description, and status.

---


## 1. Implement core analysis and ML module
**Status:** Complete
- `analysis.js` module created and integrated for core analytics/ML logic.
- Refactored analytical code into this module.
- Implemented advanced pattern mining: frequency, number pairing, and gap analysis (**done, unit tested**).
- All core analytics and ML/AI features are now robust, modular, and testable.

## 2. Integrate advanced pattern analysis into UI
**Status:** Complete
- UI components for number pairing/grouping and gap analysis visualization implemented.
- Controls for selecting/weighting prediction strategies added.
- Analytics outputs from `analysis.js` are now displayed in the UI.
## 3. Fix repeated numbers and analytics/ML display bugs (Energy Signature, AI Predictions, Recommendations)
**Status:** Complete
- Enforced deduplication in energy analysis and recommendations logic.
- Rebuilt app to ensure latest code changes are included in the bundle.
- Verified that Energy Signature Analysis, AI Predictions, and Recommendations now display unique, correct results in the UI.

## 4. Finalize worker and state management modules
**Status:** Not started
- Complete the implementation of `workers.js` for offloading all heavy computations (ML training, backtesting) to web workers.
- Implement `state.js` to provide robust application state management using a pub/sub pattern.
- Ensure smooth communication between UI, state, and worker modules.

## 5. Standardize and improve error handling and validation
**Status:** Not started
- Replace all `alert()` calls with a non-blocking notification area in the UI.
- Standardize error handling patterns throughout the codebase using async/await and try/catch.
- Strengthen CSV and input validation to ensure only high-quality data is analyzed.

## 6. Increase automated and unit test coverage
**Status:** Not started
- Use the new test-utils to rapidly expand unit and integration test coverage, focusing on ML, analysis, and CSV handling modules.
- Add tests for new analytical features and worker/state integration.
- Use Playwright for E2E testing and confirm multi-browser coverage.

## 7. Begin parameter optimization automation
**Status:** Not started
- Start developing local automation (hybrid API or scripts) to optimize predictive parameters for analytical models.
- Prepare for future expansion to server-side API as needed.
- Document approaches and expose controls for optimization in the UI.

## 8. Add advanced backtesting visualization
**Status:** Not started
- Integrate visualization libraries like Chart.js or D3.js to display backtesting and prediction performance metrics.
- Allow users to compare different strategies visually.
- Ensure visualizations are accessible and performant.

## 9. Implement export and data management features
**Status:** Not started
- Add functionality to export analytical results and strategies as CSV or PDF.
- Provide UI controls for import/export and ensure all exported data matches the structure/quality of analyzed results.

## 10. Audit accessibility and optimize performance
**Status:** Not started
- Review and improve accessibility (labels, ARIA, keyboard navigation) in all UI components.
- Profile and optimize performance, especially for large datasets and heavy UI updates.
