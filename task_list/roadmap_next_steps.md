1. **Optimize `valueToNumbers` Offsets (`ml.js`)**

	- Current fixed offsets are a heuristic. Systematic backtesting can empirically determine which offsets best correlate LSTM outputs to actual winning numbers.
	- Automate by running historical predictions with many offset combinations, scoring each by match rate, and selecting the best.
	- Use grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization for efficiency.


2. **Optimize `Strategy` Weights (`strategy.js`)**

	- User-defined weights are subjective; automated optimization can find weights that maximize real-world performance.
	- Backtest strategies with different weight sets on historical data, using a metric like “hit rate” (how often winners are in the top N).
	- Use grid search, random search, or evolutionary algorithms (like genetic algorithms) to efficiently search the weight space.


3. **Offload Backtesting to a Server**

	- Backtesting is computationally intensive, especially with many parameter combinations.
	- Running this on a separate server (or cloud function) allows for parallelization and won’t block the UI.
	- The client can submit jobs and poll for results, or you can use web workers for local parallelism if the dataset is small.

**Additional Suggestions:**

- Use cross-validation: Split historical data into training/validation sets to avoid overfitting offsets/weights to a single period.
- Log and visualize results: Store the best parameter sets and their performance for transparency and future analysis.
- Consider ensemble approaches: Combine several top-performing parameter sets for more robust predictions.

**Next Steps:**

- Modularize the code so offsets and weights are easily parameterized.
- Build a backtesting module (locally or server-side) that can run many simulations and report results.
- Optionally, create a simple UI for launching optimization jobs and viewing results.

## Roadmap: Refactor and Modernize lottery-analysis-pro

## 1. Syntax Errors and Critical Issues

- [x] Move all nested functions (e.g., runAnalysis) to the top level of the IIFE. <!-- Completed: modularization step -->
- [x] Remove/consolidate duplicate function definitions (e.g., cancelAnalysis). <!-- Completed: modularization step -->
- [x] Remove unused functions and variables. <!-- Completed: modularization step -->
- [x] Fix linter errors (optional chaining, Promise rejection, array sort, etc.). <!-- Completed: modularization step -->
- [x] Ensure all event handlers reference the correct, single function. <!-- Completed: modularization step -->
- [x] Refactor code to avoid deep function nesting (especially in CSV parsing and callbacks). <!-- Completed: parseCSVWithPapaParse modularization -->
- [x] Refactor array sort operations inside case blocks to use toSorted or separate statements. <!-- Completed: modularization step -->

## 2. Code Organization & Modularization

- [x] Split app.js into logical modules:
			- [x] ui.js (UI rendering, DOM manipulation) <!-- Completed -->
			- [x] csv-parser.js (CSV parsing logic) <!-- Completed -->
			- [ ] state.js (application state management)
			- [ ] analysis.js (analysis and ML logic)
			- [ ] workers.js (web worker communication)
- [x] Centralize DOM element queries and creation in one place (initUIElements). <!-- Completed -->

## 3. State Management

- [ ] Refactor state to use a simple pub/sub or observer pattern.
- [ ] Make state updates explicit and predictable.

## 4. Error Handling

- [ ] Replace alert() with a non-blocking notification area.
- [ ] Standardize error handling patterns (async/await + try/catch).

## 5. DOM Manipulation & Security

- [ ] Replace innerHTML with safer DOM APIs where possible.
- [ ] Ensure all dynamic content is sanitized or created via DOM methods.

## 6. Worker Communication

- [ ] Create a worker helper module for consistent, robust communication and error handling.

## 7. Linting, Testing, and Documentation

- [x] Set up Playwright and E2E tests for core UI and CSV upload. <!-- Completed: 2025-08-29 -->
- [x] Add Playwright multi-browser config (Brave, Chrome, Firefox). <!-- Completed: 2025-08-29 -->
- [x] Confirm Playwright HTML report is generated and accessible. <!-- Completed: 2025-08-29 -->
- [ ] Set up ESLint and basic unit tests.
- [ ] Add JSDoc/type annotations and update documentation.

## 8. Accessibility and Performance

- [ ] Audit and improve accessibility (labels, ARIA, keyboard nav).
- [ ] Optimize any slow UI updates.

---

**Implementation will proceed in this order, grouping related items for efficiency and stability.**

---

**Current Status:**

- UI and CSV parsing logic are fully modularized.
- DOM queries and initialization are centralized.
- Linter and syntax errors are resolved.
- Playwright E2E tests and multi-browser config are complete and passing.
- The codebase is ready for server/browser testing and further feature work.
