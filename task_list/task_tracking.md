- **mm:** Month (01-12)
- **dd:** Day (01-31)
- **yyyy:** Year (e.g., 2025)
- **n1, n2, n3, n4, n5:** White balls (integers 1-69, no repeats in a single draw)
- **powerball:** Red ball (Powerball, integer 1-26, drawn from a separate pool)
- **multiplier:** Powerball multiplier (2, 3, 4, 5, or 10) â€” present in the file but ignored by the analysis and not user-selectable.

**Rules:**
- White balls (n1-n5) are unique within a draw and range from 1 to 69 inclusive.
- The red ball (powerball) ranges from 1 to 26 inclusive and is drawn independently from the white balls.
- The multiplier column is not used in analysis or prediction.
- The parser expects at least the first 10 columns; extra columns (like multiplier) are ignored.
