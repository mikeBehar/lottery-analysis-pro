## Performance Characteristics

### Browser Mode
- **Pros**: No setup, works offline, data stays local
- **Cons**: Limited CPU utilization, memory constraints, UI blocking
- **Best for**: Datasets under 500 draws, casual testing

### Server Mode
- **Pros**: Full CPU utilization, parallel processing, background execution
- **Cons**: Requires setup, additional complexity, network dependency
- **Best for**: Datasets over 500 draws, intensive testing, repeated analysis

### Auto-Detection Logic
- Small datasets (â‰¤500 draws): Recommend browser processing
- Medium datasets (500-1000 draws): Recommend server with 2-3x speedup
- Large datasets (1000+ draws): Strongly recommend server with 5x+ speedup
- Complexity multipliers: Low (1x), Medium (2x), High (4x), Maximum (8x)

## Configuration Options

### Accuracy Testing Parameters
```javascript
{
  minTrainingSize: 100,          // Minimum historical draws for training
  testWindowSize: 50,            // Size of each test window
  bootstrapIterations: 1000,     // Bootstrap sampling iterations
  confidenceLevel: 0.95,         // Statistical confidence level
  enableLSTM: true,              // Enable neural network predictions
  enableProgressReporting: true  // Real-time progress updates
}
```

### Server Configuration
```javascript
{
  port: 3001,                    // Server port
  host: 'localhost',             // Server host
  workers: os.cpus().length,     // Number of worker processes
  maxJobTime: 600000,            // 10-minute job timeout
  cleanupInterval: 30000,        // 30-second cleanup interval
  corsOrigins: ['http://localhost:5500', 'file://']
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Accuracy Test
```javascript
const tester = new EnhancedAccuracyTester(historicalData);
const results = await tester.runAccuracyTest(progressCallback);
console.log(`Ensemble accuracy: ${results.ensemble.accuracy.overallScore}`);
```

### Server-Accelerated Testing
```javascript
const serverManager = new ServerManager();
const results = await serverManager.runAccuracyTestWithServerManager(
  tester, 
  { preferServer: true, fallbackToBrowser: true }
);

const performanceUI = new PerformanceUI();
await performanceUI.init();
performanceUI.setHistoricalData(data);
await performanceUI.runAccuracyTest();
