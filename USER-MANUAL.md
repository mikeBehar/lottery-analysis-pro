## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What's the minimum amount of data needed?**
A: 20 draws minimum, but 100+ draws recommended for reliable predictions. More data generally means better accuracy.

**Q: How often should I update my analysis?**
A: Update after every 10-20 new draws. Run optimization after every 50+ new draws for best results.

**Q: Can I use data from different lotteries?**
A: The system is designed for Powerball format (5 numbers 1-69, powerball 1-26). Other 5+1 lotteries may work with parameter adjustment.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What does the confidence score mean?**
A: Confidence scores indicate how certain the system is about predictions:
- 80%+: High confidence (strong consensus across methods)
- 60-80%: Medium confidence (good secondary choices)
- <60%: Lower confidence (consider alternative strategies)

**Q: Which prediction method is most accurate?**
A: No single method is always best. The enhanced recommendations combine multiple approaches for optimal results. Historical backtesting shows hybrid approaches typically perform best.

**Q: How do I interpret position-based confidence intervals?**
A: Example: Ball 1 prediction of 8 ±4 means the number is likely between 4-12. Narrower intervals indicate higher certainty.

### Strategy Questions

**Q: Should I always use high confidence numbers?**
A: Not necessarily. Consider:
- High confidence for primary strategy
- Medium confidence for variety
- Alternative strategies for different playing styles

**Q: How do I know if my strategy is working?**
A: Use the accuracy testing feature to backtest your approach. Look for:
- Hit rate >15% for 3+ matches
- Consistent performance over time
- Improvement over random selection

**Q: Can I combine multiple strategies?**
A: Yes! Many users successfully combine approaches:
- Use high confidence numbers as base
- Add medium confidence numbers for variety
- Apply alternative strategies for special draws

### Advanced Usage

**Q: What's the difference between bootstrap and normal confidence intervals?**
A: 
- **Bootstrap**: More robust, better for small datasets, computationally intensive
- **Normal**: Faster, assumes normal distribution, good for large datasets
- **Time-weighted**: Emphasizes recent patterns, best for trending analysis

**Q: How do I optimize for specific goals?**
A:
- **Maximum hits**: Focus on frequency analysis and hot numbers
- **Jackpot hunting**: Use pattern avoidance and balanced range strategies  
- **Consistent play**: Emphasize medium confidence numbers and bootstrap intervals

**Q: Should I use the same strategy for every draw?**
A: Consider varying your approach:
- Use optimized strategy as baseline
- Apply alternative strategies occasionally
