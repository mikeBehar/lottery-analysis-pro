 
Advanced Analysis RoadmapYE
1. Advanced Analysis Engine

1a. Temporal Weighting: Implement time-decay to weight recent draws more heavily than older ones.

1b. Number Pairing/Grouping Analysis: Identify numbers that frequently appear together.

1c. Enhanced Gap Analysis: Calculate the statistically "expected" gap for each number to find truly "overdue" numbers, not just infrequent ones.

2. Validation & Analytics Suite

2a. Rolling Window Analysis (5 Groups): Visually show how predictions change over different eras of data (not just a table).

2b. Comprehensive Backtesting: Implement walk-forward testing to generate key performance metrics: Hit Rate ("X numbers right Y% of the time"), Precision, Recall, and simulated ROI.

3. UI & Control Panel

3a. Fine-Tuning Dashboard: Expose key parameters (Energy Weights, Time-Decay rate, ML confidence thresholds) in the UI for users to tweak and experiment with.

3b. Tiered Recommendations: Formalize the output into three confidence-based tiers: High-Confidence Core, Medium-Confidence Pool, and Long-Shot Wildcards.

4. Visualization

4a. Prediction Evolution Chart: A line or bar chart showing how the top predicted numbers changed across the 5 time windows.

4b. Performance Metrics Dashboard: A clear display of backtesting results (accuracy, hit rate, etc.).

Temporal Weighting

Number Pairing/Grouping Analysis -- This could be a separate model whose output gets incorporated into the final recommendation.

 enhance the basic gap analysis (cold numbers) by calculating the statistical "expected" gap for each number 

Implement the idea of using 5 groups (time windows) to see how the predictions may be changing. provide this as a visual not just a table..

 Implement Backtesting  Based on past performance, this model can be expected to get X numbers right Y% of the time."

Implement Fine-tuning and expise the the UI parameters than can be tweeked.


provide tiered recommendations based on confidence levels.

Lets discuss these topics before you create any code or code examples.
Answer each question then wait for my response (I'll say NEXT) before moving on to the next question.
If you have no questions, then start. 
1.The result we get after an analysis produces a set of numbers  (the Prediction) that are most likely to be draw in the next game. Is that correct?
2. What are you thoughts about how to predict the winning numbers in the next available draw? 
3. How cqn we see how the predications may be changing. For example if we create  5 groups of draws where each group is over a specific duration. Then if we use each group as a basis for calculating out next prediction. Would that not show us how those predications change over time?
4. We discussed testing the accuracy of predictions,  How exactly would that work and is it worthwhile?
5. Are there any parameters than can be fine tunes based on the results of testing. For example, is the array called grid subject to tuning.
6. If I give you a date, what do you think about giving me 3 best predictions for the next future available draw date
in version 2.1.0

Are current predicions specifically for next draw date  or some unknown future date


give it a date and have it give 3 more likely next draw for next future draw available date



Still no prediction testing

After running ML strategy I select Energy analysis. console shows running energy analysis on 1830 draws, but the analysis does not dtop and there is no progress indicator.
